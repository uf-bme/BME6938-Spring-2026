    "\n",
    "- Suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as you type\n",
    "- Converting comments into working code\n",
    "- Helping you understand and work with unfamiliar libraries\n",
    "- Offering multiple suggestions for you to choose from\n",
    "- Learning from your coding style and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started with Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Copilot through GitHub Student Developer Pack**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)\n",
    "   - Once approved, activate your free Copilot subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Copilot in Your Development Environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - VS Code: Install the \"GitHub Copilot\" extension\n",
    "   - GitHub Codespaces: Copilot is available by default\n",
    "   - JupyterLab: Install the Copilot extension\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   - Look for the Copilot icon in your editor's status bar\n",

    "# Ethics and Responsible Use of GitHub Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, it's important to consider several ethical dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Ownership and Attribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the source**: Copilot is trained on public code repositories, which may include copyrighted material\n",
    "- **Review generated code**: Always examine suggestions before accepting them\n",
    "- **Avoid blind copying**: Don't accept code you don't understand or can't explain\n",
    "- **Check licenses**: Be aware that suggested code might be based on code with specific licensing requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Academic Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Follow institutional policies**: Check your school's guidelines on AI tool usage for assignments\n",
    "- **Transparent usage**: Acknowledge when you've used Copilot for coursework or projects\n",
    "- **Learning vs. automation**: Use Copilot to enhance learning, not replace understanding\n",
    "- **Original thinking**: Ensure you're developing your own problem-solving skills alongside AI assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Security and Privacy Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitive data**: Never input personal, confidential, or proprietary information into Copilot prompts\n",
    "- **Code review**: AI-generated code may contain security vulnerabilities or bugs\n",
    "- **Data handling**: Be mindful of how Copilot processes your code and comments\n",
    "- **Medical context**: Extra caution needed when building healthcare applications with patient data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bias and Fairness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic bias**: AI models can perpetuate biases present in training data\n",
    "- **Inclusive design**: Review generated code for accessibility and inclusive practices\n",
    "- **Cultural sensitivity**: Be aware that AI suggestions may not account for diverse perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices for Ethical Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Treat Copilot as a collaborator**, not a replacement for critical thinking\n",
    "2. **Validate all suggestions** through testing and code review\n",
    "3. **Maintain coding skills** - don't become overly dependent on AI assistance\n",

    "- “Propose a folder structure for a small React medical dashboard.”\n",
