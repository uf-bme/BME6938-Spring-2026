    "# What is GitHub Copilot?\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as you type\n",
    "- Converting comments into working code\n",
    "- Helping you understand and work with unfamiliar libraries\n",
    "- Offering multiple suggestions for you to choose from\n",
    "- Learning from your coding style and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started with Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Copilot through GitHub Student Developer Pack**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)\n",
    "   - Once approved, activate your free Copilot subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Copilot in Your Development Environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - VS Code: Install the \"GitHub Copilot\" extension\n",
    "   - GitHub Codespaces: Copilot is available by default\n",
    "   - JupyterLab: Install the Copilot extension\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   - Look for the Copilot icon in your editor's status bar\n",
    "   - The icon should be active (not grayed out)\n",
    "   - You might need to sign in to GitHub to activate Copilot\n"

    "# Ethics and Responsible Use of GitHub Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, it's important to consider several ethical dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Ownership and Attribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the source**: Copilot is trained on public code repositories, which may include copyrighted material\n",
    "- **Review generated code**: Always examine suggestions before accepting them\n",
    "- **Avoid blind copying**: Don't accept code you don't understand or can't explain\n",
    "- **Check licenses**: Be aware that suggested code might be based on code with specific licensing requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Academic Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Follow institutional policies**: Check your school's guidelines on AI tool usage for assignments\n",
    "- **Transparent usage**: Acknowledge when you've used Copilot for coursework or projects\n",
    "- **Learning vs. automation**: Use Copilot to enhance learning, not replace understanding\n",
    "- **Original thinking**: Ensure you're developing your own problem-solving skills alongside AI assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Security and Privacy Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitive data**: Never input personal, confidential, or proprietary information into Copilot prompts\n",
    "- **Code review**: AI-generated code may contain security vulnerabilities or bugs\n",
    "- **Data handling**: Be mindful of how Copilot processes your code and comments\n",
    "- **Medical context**: Extra caution needed when building healthcare applications with patient data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bias and Fairness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic bias**: AI models can perpetuate biases present in training data\n",
    "- **Inclusive design**: Review generated code for accessibility and inclusive practices\n",
    "- **Cultural sensitivity**: Be aware that AI suggestions may not account for diverse perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices for Ethical Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Treat Copilot as a collaborator**, not a replacement for critical thinking\n",
    "2. **Validate all suggestions** through testing and code review\n",
    "3. **Maintain coding skills** - don't become overly dependent on AI assistance\n",
    "4. **Stay informed** about your organization's AI usage policies\n",
    "5. **Consider the impact** of your code on users and society\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remember**: You are ultimately responsible for the code you write and deploy, regardless of whether it was human-generated or AI-assisted.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open `main.lua` in your project folder and delete the contents.\n",
    "- Open Copilot Chat using **`Ctrl+Shift+I`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+I`** (Mac)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Use Copilot Chat to Guide Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just writing comments, use Copilot Chat's agent mode:\n",

    "1. **Ask Copilot to explain LÖVE2D basics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   @workspace Can you explain how LÖVE2D works and what functions I need for a simple game?\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "2. **Request specific code generation:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Generate a simple LÖVE2D game with a bouncing ball that changes color when hitting edges (or make your own game!)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Iterate with Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `/fix` command if there are issues with the generated code\n",
    "- Use the `/explain` command to understand any unfamiliar parts\n",
    "- Ask follow-up questions like: \"How can I add player controls?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Chat Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these in Copilot Chat:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Create a LÖVE2D game loop with a ball that bounces off screen edges`\n",
    "- `Add keyboard controls to move the ball with arrow keys`\n",
    "- `Change the ball color when it hits different edges`\n",
    "\n",
